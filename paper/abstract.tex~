\begin{abstract}
While it is not recommended, Internet users often include parts of
personal information in their passwords for easy
memorization. However, the use of personal information in passwords
and its security implications have not yet been studied systematically
in the past.  In this paper, we first dissect user passwords from a
leaked dataset to investigate how and to what extent user personal
information resides in a password. In particular, we extract the most
popular password structures expressed by personal information, and we
introduce a new metric called Coverage to quantify the correlation
between passwords and personal information. Then, exploiting the
potential of cracking passwords based on our analysis, we develop a
semantics-richer Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars method called
Personal-PCFG to crack passwords. Through offlline and online attack
scenarios, we demonstrate that Personal-PCFG cracks passwords much
faster than the state-of-art techniques and makes online attacks much
easier to succeed.  To defend against such semantics-aware attacks, we
propose to use simple distortion functions that are chosen by users to
mitigate unwanted correlation between personal information and
passwords. Our experimental results show that a simple distortion can
effectively protect a password from personalized cracking without
sacraficing usability.
